# name-whirl: a Name Spinner

### MVP

A name spinner that can rotate and select a single random name from a given list.

### Future updates

Users will have the ability to access a session through a provided link and enter their own usernames. When the spinner is activated, it will consider the usernames entered by users in the current session as part of the selection pool. The spinner will randomly choose a username from this pool.
